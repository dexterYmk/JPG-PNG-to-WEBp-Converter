# JPG-PNG-to-WEBp-Converter
this code is made to convert JPG, PNG, JPEG files to WEBP for online use. I coded this to convert the image formats to upload on my shopify store. 
Just change the file path for the input folder and the output folder and run the file. it will work fluently showing how many files it converted in the terminal.
you can modify this code to convert any kind off file to another file. this code uses the pillow library from python and os library.
